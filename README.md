# CitiBike_OperationsOptimisation
This project is to optimise the relocation of the bikes for the bike sharing platform of Citibike. 
We spotted the imbalance of the bike stocks around New York and set the goal to optimise the model to improve the operations, especially during peak time using **integer programming model**.
